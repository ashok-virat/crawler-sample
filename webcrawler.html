<p>Preparing test data for a web crawler and scraper involves creating a dataset that mimics the structure and content
    of the data you expect to collect from the web. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it: Identify Target
    Websites: Determine which websites or types of web pages you want to crawl and scrape. This will help you understand
    the structure and types of data available. Analyze the Structure: Look at the HTML and JavaScript structure of the
    target web pages to identify the patterns and tags that contain the data you want to extract. Create Mock HTML
    Pages: Based on your analysis, create mock HTML pages that replicate the structure of the target web pages. Include
    various elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and links. Incorporate Edge Cases: Ensure your mock pages
    include edge cases, such as missing data, unexpected HTML tags, or dynamic content loaded with JavaScript. Generate
    Data: Populate the mock pages with realistic data. You can use tools or libraries to generate fake data that
    resembles real-world information. Test Your Crawler/Scraper: Use your web crawler and scraper on the mock pages to
    ensure it can handle different scenarios and extract the data accurately. Validate and Iterate: Check the extracted
    data against the expected results. If there are discrepancies, adjust your crawler/scraper and test again.
    Performance Testing: Test the crawler/scraper against a large number of mock pages to evaluate its performance and
    robustness. Compliance Check: Make sure your test data and crawling/scraping activities comply with legal
    requirements, such as the website's robots.txt file and terms of service.</p>
